controller
- I want to download a list of worker nodes up front (without having to query the AWS API).
- I want to programmatically get instance names.
- I want to split tests from jest. Should I use the CLI API?

packer vs terraform
- packer: AMI builder
- terraform: declarative AWS configuration

yarn test --listTests

retries with jest-junit?

yarn test

# region is a transient parameter only used when creating the AMI.
packer build worker.json
packer validate worker.json

terraform init # call when you change the backend.
terraform apply # deploy.
terraform show # view the running deployment.
terraform destroy

terraform show includes a lot of details about the live instance that weren't specified in the tf file.

both terraform and packer include provisioners.
I believe this is strictly so that the image itself can include some provisioning.
I wish terraform and packer relied on a common provisioning library.
